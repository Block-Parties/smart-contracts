# Block Parties' smart contracts

## For Builders

Building on top of Block Parties is meant to be easy - to get started, download and add these two files to your project:
- IPartyHost.sol: An interface that defines the minimum a "party host" contract needs to be compatible with BlockParties.
- IBlockParties.sol: An interface that exposes the main functionality most "party host" contracts will need from the BlockParties contract.


## For Contributors

The main act of fractionalization and stake management is handled via `BlockParties.sol`.

We welcome contributions, but before working on anything, please create a Github issue for discussion!

Note: Any security concerns should be sent via email to andres@blockparties.io instead of published publically as an issue, to avoid encouraging exploitation.
